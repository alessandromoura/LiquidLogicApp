# Transforming JSON in Logic Apps using Liquid Templates

This project contains source code for the blog post I did about creating Liquid map templates to be used in Logic Apps.

You will see in the repository one ARM Template for the Logic App using Filters and Compose actions, and another ARM Template to use the Liquid map template.

You will also find the liquid map template in here.

Enjoy.
